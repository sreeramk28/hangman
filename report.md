Project Report
==============

The initial plan was drawn as to how to implement the core of the game. Initially, drawing the gallow onto the game window was attempted. Then the other aesthetic elements of the game were added viz. the blanks and the number of mistakes field and the user input field. With the basic look and field ready, the gameplay part, i.e. the guessing of the letters and drawing of the Hangman after every mistake was done. This part of the first iteration was done within two hours what was perceived to take a whole week.

Accomplishments
===============

1.  Simple core Gameplay completed
2.  Gameplay tested with possible cases

Issues faced
============

1.  Compatibility of the game on all computers. There were different outputs on different computers.
2.  Lack of a good version control system like git posed a major issue in synchronizing the work done.

What to be done next
====================

1.  Add a help screen
2.  Add more words and categories
3.  Add another game mode where words are given to the user continuously and score is tracked across all the words
