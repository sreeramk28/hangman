Project Report
==============

The initial plan was drawn as to how to implement the core of the game. Initially, drawing the gallow onto the game window was attempted. Then the other aesthetic elements of the game were added viz. the blanks and the number of mistakes field and the user input field. With the basic look and field ready, the gameplay part, i.e. the guessing of the letters and drawing of the Hangman after every mistake was done. This part of the first iteration was done within two hours what was perceived to take a whole week.
